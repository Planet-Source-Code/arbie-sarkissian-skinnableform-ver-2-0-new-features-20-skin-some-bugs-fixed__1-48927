<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Welcome to SkinnableForm 
  tutorial. My name is Arbie Sarkissian and in this tutorial I'm trying to describe 
  how you can make your VB project skinnable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First I should sorry for 
  my English, It's not so well. I hope you forgive me for It.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is second version of 
  my project. In this version, I completely changed the way of skinning. In last 
  version, you should load skin for each control manualy, which was very weariful. 
  Now this work done by using an .ini file. First skin structure sets by geting 
  settings from .ini file, and then It uses to load the skin. Editing and changing 
  the settings is easy as editing the .ini file.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New skins have added. Now 
  you can chose from 20 different skins. Only one new control had added which 
  is not very good. It's the ctrl_ProgressBar. It's a progressbar control, designed 
  to fit with new environment. Resizing and SystemMenu icon features are available 
  now. Also there's an easy way to add SystrayIcon to your project.</font></p>
