### Description

Hi. This is second version of my SkinnableForm project with main changes. First I changed the way of skinning which was really boring. Now all skin settings are read from a .ini file and changing skin is very simple by chosing a new .ini file. Now you can chose between 20 different skins added to this version.

I added some features such as Resizing, System Menu, Easy TrayIcon and fixed some bugs. I also add a HTML Tutorial that explains how you can use this project to make your own project skinnable.

There's a new control called ctrl_ProgressBar, which I designed to fit with new environment, but I'm not contented, It needs more work.

unfortunatly I couldn't upload my code because of Script Time Out error so I put it in following link:

I hope you enjoy it. Thank you for all those who leaved me notes and told me their ideas about project. Sorry that I couldn't reply. I'm expecting any help for improving this code with open arms. Please feel free to send your ideas. Thank You.

Get the code from here:
